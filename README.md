# Movie-Recommedation-system
 A movie recommendation system is a Data science project that provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their viewing history, behavior, user rating etc.It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and generate a list of movies that are most likely to appeal to the user. . It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and generate a list of movies that are most likely to appeal to the user. Movie recommendation systems are widely used by online movie streaming services, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime , to provide users with personalized recommendations and improve their overall viewing experience. To develop a such systems, data scientists need to collect and preprocess data, build and train machine learning models, and deploy the system to production. The system should be regularly updated based on user feedback and changing trends in the movie industry.
